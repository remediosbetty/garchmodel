# garchmodel
Using the model based on Garch to price European options
the main part of this file is the Monte-Carlo simulation of asset price and volatility based on the Duan's Model.
## mybeta is a .m file giving the relationship between asset price and volatility which is used for simulation
## myoptimal is a .m file to update parameters using Newton-Raphson algorithm 
the numerical method for the solution of the Heston's model was included, expecially the figure of volitility smile.
